# Restaurant-Management-System
Developed a robust Restaurant Management System using C, featuring dual interfaces for administrators and customers. Implemented functionalities include menu management, order placement, item deletion, and total sales calculation. Admins can add, delete, and view menu items, while customers can place orders, modify them, and generate final bills.
